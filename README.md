# SwiftUI-Examples

A SwiftUI app with working examples and easy to read code for creating SwiftUI basics including: buttons, sliders, pickers, toggles, modals, popovers, notifications, drawings, animations, navigation, forms, combine, bindings, environment objects and networking requests. 

This is basically a scratch pad to grab code from when building SwiftUI apps. As opposed to an online article or static website, you can build, edit and run the code in Xcode. 

Any contributions are highly appreciated!

Some of this code is straight from Paul Hudson's amazing Hacking With Swift website (https://www.hackingwithswift.com). If there are any copyright issues, please let me know. 

When I am working on an app and need a test area to try out some new SwiftuI code, I have been placing it here.
